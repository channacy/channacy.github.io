        <p class="text-xl my-4">I am a current junior at Drexel University studying computer science and mathematics with a focus on <strong>algorithms & theory</strong> and <strong>computer systems & architecture.</strong></p>
        <p class=" text-xl my-4">Currently, Iâ€™m working with the <u><a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/research/centers-labs/Interactive%20Systems%20for%20Healthcare-IS4H/">IS4H (Interactive Systems for Healthcare)</a></u>, <u><a href="https://research.coe.drexel.edu/caee/camlab/research.html">CAM (Connected & Automated Mobility)</a></u> Labs and working part-time at <u><a href="https://www.codepath.org/" target="_blank">CodePath</a></u>, where I assist teaching technical problem-solving skills to over 100 students and helping build a diverse community of engineers. In the past, I spent 12 months (two co-ops) building fintech applications at <a href="https://sig.com/" target="_blank"><u>Susquehanna</u></a>.</p>
